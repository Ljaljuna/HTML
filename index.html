		<p class="description"> In 1900, a paltry two percent of U.S. meals were eaten outside the home. In 2010, that number had climbed to approximately 50 percent. Meanwhile, under 33 percent of families sit down for a meal with each other more than twice a week, and, on average, Americans eat 46 percent of their meals alone. When we do eat with other people at home, we often sit in front of the television or have to rush to the next task on the calendar.

<p align="center" class="questions"> Why Home Cooking?
</p>
<div>

	</ul>

<p>Those mental health benefits increase considerably when we eat home-cooked meals with other people. In fact, communal meals can make us feel happier even outside of meal times. That’s partly because social connections reinforced over meals can help us cultivate a sense of belonging and even reduce symptoms of depression. Sharing the joy of home cooking also preserves cultural knowledge and history as we pass recipes from generation to generation.
As if all that weren’t enough, home-cooked meals can also benefit the environment – and all of us, by extension – by saving money and reducing our carbon footprint. Home cooking gives us the opportunity to choose component ingredients over processed meals, which cuts down on packaging. Buy those ingredients from local farmers or grow your own, and you’ll make an even bigger impact on the environment by significantly reducing the amount of </p>transportation required to get food to your plate.
